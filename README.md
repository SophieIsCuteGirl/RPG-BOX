# RPG-BOX Alpha
a small collection of assets, frameworks, and systems, made to speedup and make creating RPGs or just games in general much faster and more fun!

all assets in RPG-box are free and open source, please credit me if using them (not needed however).

my goal is to make making games as easy fun and straight forward as I can

packages (unity package file) comes out first then source code will be added slightly later, normally they'll both come out within the same 24 hour period but sometimes source code might be a bit delayed, this is because building the alpha takes only a little time while uploading all scripts models examples etc and making directories changelogs and documentation for them all is timeconsuming and annoying tbh, so source code is slightly behind.
